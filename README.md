## Introduction
> “Create your own visual style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others.” – Orson Welles

This is my third time remaking my entire site from scratch. This time around, I've opted to make a single page site with VueJS, Bootstrap, and some custom CSS. It's a fairly minimalistic design, but be warned, only those who seek will find (a few easter eggs and programmer humor)...

## Built With
* HTML/CSS/JS
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/)
